I'm Coen van der Geest an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Digitalization](https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-digitalization) at Copenhagen Business School (CBS), with a PhD from [KIN Center for Digital Innovation](https://www.kinresearch.nl) at the School of Business and Economics of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. 

My research explores how the architectural configuration of digital technologies shapes organizational and societal outcomes. I investigate how design choices, particularly in APIs, platform architectures, and IT infrastructures, enable or constrain their potential, influencing both strategic and operational results. My goal is to provide practical and theoretical insights into how the technical design of digital technologies affects an organizationsâ€™ ability to create value and the potential broader implications for society.
